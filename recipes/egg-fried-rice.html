    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Don't call the Chinese takeaway – make your own egg-fried rice.</p>
    <p>Use leftover rice, or cook and dry it on a plate before using so it doesn't stick to the wok</p> 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g long grain rice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice – stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve.</li>
    </ol>
